In order to install pygame locally on your pc run in terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To play the game run in terminal: python game.py

The game has a main.py file which is used to set up a Mongo database and store information such as the score, player, age, and more. The main goal of this project is to learn more about classes and objects in Python by using Pygame as a framework. I want to publish this game online in the future.
